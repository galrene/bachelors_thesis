2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance io_controller/DC_BR/bram_memory_reg_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance io_controller/DC_BR/bram_memory_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clock_generator_inst/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sensor_clk_clock_generator and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sensor_clk_clock_generator] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sensor_clk_clock_generator and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sensor_clk_clock_generator] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset_n_in relative to clock(s) clock_generator_inst/inst/clk_in1, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on rx_i relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on tx_o relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clock_generator_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clock_generator_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
